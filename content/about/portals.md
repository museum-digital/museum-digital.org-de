## Themator: Topical Portals

The [Themator](/software/themator) is a tool we developed to enable museums and like-minded people to create digital exhibitions and - more generally - to easily engage in digital storytelling. As the Themator was previously largely monolingual, we have set up different instances of it.

## md:term: The controlled vocabularies of museum-digital made accessible

Around 2010, we started to use controlled vocabularies to facilitate the common tagging and interlinking of digitized objects. For a long time, these vocabularies were not accessible for any outside viewers. Since they may be a useful resource to some, we have since developed [md:term](/software/term_nodac) as a public and hopefully easily accessible portal for our (and some other) controlled vocabularies.
